# Object-Detection-Image-Segmentation-COCO-Dataset-
Object Detection Models: YOLO and SSD 
* Image Segmentation Models: FCN, SegNet, UNet, and DeepLabv3

Object Detection aims at providing a bounding box around the desired object class, while image segmentation aims at providing a pixel mask over the entire object class. See below:

Subset of COCO dataset is used which contains 20 out of the original 91 classes, with around 500 images for each class. This still provides a diverse dataset of 10,732 images in total which significantly reduces resources needed/training time (7771 of these images are used for training and 2961 for validation).
